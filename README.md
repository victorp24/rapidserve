### Description

RapidServe is a mobile application which allows restaurants to charge
their customers through a mobile application interface. Powered
with a React Native frontend and Python Flask API server with a
mongoDB database, RapidServe uses QR codes linked to tables to
allow the customer to scan the QR code at their table and pay for
any item at their table. Once all the items at the customers table
are paid for, the customer is free to go and the waiter/waitress
does not need to be bothered and wait for each customer at a
table to pay individually.
